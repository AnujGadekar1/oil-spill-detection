# AI-Based Early Oil Spill Detection System 🌊🛢️

An intelligent, AI-powered environmental monitoring system designed to proactively detect potential oil spills using real-time AIS (Automatic Identification System) data and satellite imagery analysis. This system empowers regulatory agencies with faster decision-making and response capabilities to minimize environmental damage.

## 🚀 Overview

Oil spills pose a major threat to marine ecosystems, coastal economies, and global sustainability efforts. This project combines machine learning, geospatial analysis, and automation to detect anomalies in vessel movement patterns and verify suspected spill areas through satellite image processing.

### 🔍 Key Features

- **Real-Time Anomaly Detection**  
  Utilizes AIS data to track vessels and flag suspicious behaviors like sudden speed drops, sharp course changes, or unusual halts.

- **Satellite Imagery Confirmation**  
  Automatically pulls satellite imagery of the flagged zones and applies computer vision techniques to detect visual signs of oil spills.

- **Automated Alert System**  
  Sends instant alerts to environmental agencies, improving response time and facilitating early intervention.

- **Modular and Scalable Design**  
  Easily integrable with other monitoring systems, supports plug-and-play models for anomaly detection and image classification.

🧪 Sample Use Case
Input: AIS data stream with vessel ID, coordinates, speed, course, and timestamps.

Output: Email/SMS/Web alert with location, suspected vessel ID, timestamp, and image confirmation of potential oil spill.

📈 Results & Impact
Reduced response time from hours to minutes by automatic detection and validation.

Significant reduction in false alarms through hybrid ML + visual confirmation.

Scalable to multiple oceans and compatible with satellite feeds like Sentinel-1, Landsat, or commercial APIs.
